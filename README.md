# CraftyAnimationEditor
This is a graphical editor for animations and sprites for CraftyJS. This will (eventually) output crafty component files and json strings as desired for uploaded sprite sheets.

# How to use

You can't export anything yet. You can name a local file and it's sheet dimensions as expected by a Crafty.load call (paddingx and paddingy are combined into just padding, and there isn't a padding around border). 
Hit upload, then add animations with the green plus.
You can't delete animations yet.

Right click on frames in the sprite sheet to push them to the current frames in the animation.
Right click on frames in the animation to remove them from the animation.

Click and drag on frames in the sprite sheet to manually replace individual frames in the animation.
